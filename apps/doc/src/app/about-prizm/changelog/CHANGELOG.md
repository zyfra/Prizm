### Breacking Changes

#### Removed components

- `input-date-time`
- `input-date-time-range`
- `input-time`
- `input-date`
- `input-month`
- `input-month-range`
- `input-date-range`
- `input-date-relative`
- `select`
- `multi-select`
- `carousel`

These components will no longer be supported and a replacement must be found to find alternative components with input-layout.

#### Theme

- Legacy color tokens (v1, v2) have been completely removed. Mapping for new colors will be provided where possible. Colors without direct analogues in the new color scheme will require manual redefinition in projects.
- Tokens with the prizm-v3 prefix have been replaced with prizm-

#### Icons

The `prizm-icon` component has been removed. Instead, a new set of icons has been introduced in the `prizm-icons` component, where the icons have new names. For each of the old icons, alternative names are provided. You can find a complete table of correspondence between old and new icon names at the link: https://prizm.site/components/icons/Old_Icons.

The following components used the legacy icon component:

- accordion
- table
- breadcrumbs
- tabs
- button
- icon-button
- split-button
- primitive-spin-button
- primitive-year-month-pagination
- calendar-range
- column-settings
- toggle
- input-select
- input-multi-select
  -file-upload
- navigation-menu
- indicator
- input-icon-button
- dropdown-host
- tree
- stepper
- checkbox
- tooltip
  -paginator

This means that when using the above components in your projects, you will need to either manually update the icon names to new ones, or use our service, which will automatically update the icon names to their new versions. Instructions for using this service are available at: https://prizm.site/components/icons#migrate-from-old-name.
